# Version Logs

## Version: Beta 1.0 (July 1st, 2024 1:22PM MDT)
Created this project. Beta version of url shortener for ice dodo. This contains many features such as block counting. This will be constantly updated and is single handedly programmed by D王 [ML], no collaboration/collaborators involved. This shortens more than awehero's and applepear's shorteners. Also has a block count feature.

## Version: Beta 1.1 (July 5th, 2024 8:44PM MDT)
Created this version log and added a link on the website (Right above "Support D王 [ML] now!") so users can view logs.

## Version: Beta 1.2 (July 5th, 2024 8:55PM MDT)
Removed the token feature so everyone can use it. It used to have a token slot where user enters a token, they can only use if it is correct. Now it is removed. Beta token was "02".

## Release (July 5th, 2024 8:58PM MDT)
Released into onionfist server so everyone can use. Extra thanks to MooshMM who announced in small announce and Killugon who pinned the message.

## Version: Beta 1.3 (July 6th, 2024 9:47AM MDT)
Made a remove duplicating block feature. When I make maps, I use Shift+D to duplicate, but then a lot of times, I forget if I have duplicated. This feature ensures that those 50+ characters for each duplicated blocks aren't wasted.

## Version: Beta 1.4 (July 7th, 2024 2:14PM MDT)
Made format changes, added a copy button so you can copy to clipboard right away. The link is now compressed when shown, thus easy to see. Triple click can select the entire link. Also added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">.
